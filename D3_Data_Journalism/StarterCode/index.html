          <h2><strong>Correlations Discovered Between Household Income and Obesity in United States</h2><hr>
          <p>Poor people in America are disproportionately affected by obesity. 
            In the decade from 2004 through 2013, obesity increased about one percent on average among the top 25 wealthiest U.S. counties. 
            Averaged among the 25 poorest U.S. counties, the obesity increase for that decade was more than 10 percent.</p>

          <p>There is a strong negative correlation between household income and both obesity and diabetes. 
            This negative correlation, however, has only developed in the past 30 years, according to researchers 
            in Tennessee and London. Since 1990, the correlation between household income and obesity rate has grown steadily, 
            from virtually no correlation to a very strong correlation by 2016.</p>

          <p>For a long time researchers have tracked high rates of obesity among black and Hispanic kids, 
            but a closer look at communities shows family income matters more than race in predicting which kids are overweight.</p>
